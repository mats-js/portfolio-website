      <div class="case-study-intro">
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          myFlix is a movies database web application based on the MERN stack.
          After the user creates an account, the app provides her with
          information about selected movies, as well as the respective directors
          and genres. The user can add/remove favorite movies and manage her
          account data.
        </p>
        <h2>Purpose and Context</h2>
        <p>
          The application was a mandatory project to be completed as part of the
          CareerFoundry Full-Stack Web Development curriculum.
        </p>
        <h2>Objective</h2>
        <p>
          The objective of the project was to gain a deeper understanding of
          both front- and backend development with JavaScript-based
          technologies, as well as bringing the front- and backend together to
          create a working web application.

        <h2>Duration</h2>
        <p>2.5 weeks for the server-side, 1.5 weeks for the client-side.</p>
        <h2>Credits</h2>

        <h2>Tools, Skills, Methodologies</h2>
        <p>
          <i>For the server-side:</i> Node.js, Express, MongoDB/Shell, Mongoose
          for database models, Postman for API testing, Passport for HTTP
          authentication and JWT token, Bcrypt for password hashing,
          Express-Validator for input validation.<br />
          <i>For the client-side:</i> React, React Bootstrap, React-Redux,
          Parcel.

        <h2>Approach and Process</h2>
        <h3>1. Server-Side Implementation</h3>
        <p>
          For the server-side, I created a RESTful API based on Node.js and
          Express that accesses a noSQL database (MongoDB) via common HTTP
          methods. The database uses CRUD operations for manipulation and
          provides data in JSON format.

        /><br />
        <h3>2. Client-Side Implementation</h3>
        <p>
          After the server-side was up-and-running, I created a
          single-page-application with React and React-Redux based on a project
          brief that needed to include the following views:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Main view: Returns a list of ALL movies to the user (each listed
            item with an image, title, and description), allows for sorting and
            filtering, includes the ability to select a movie for more details.
          </li>
          <li>
            Single movie view: Returns data (description, genre, director,
            image) about a single movie to the user and allows users to add a
            movie to their list of favorites.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <img

          class="case-study-image"
          alt="Screenshot of the web application myflix, depicting a movie view with information about a single movie"
        />
        <ul>
          <li>
            Login view: Allows users to log in with a username and password.
          </li>
          <li>
            Registration view: Allows new users to register (username, password,
            email, birthday).
          </li>
          <li>
            Genre view: Returns data about a genre, with a name and description
            and displays example movies.
          </li>
          <li>
            Director view: Returns data about a director (name, bio, birth year,
            death year) and displays example movies.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Challenges and Learnings</h2>
        <p>
          Given that this was my first (larger) project based on React, it took
          me a bit of time to get accustomed to React's structure and in
          particular the use of state across components. Setting up the backend
          first definitely helped me tackle this project, as trying to implement
          both front- and backend simultaneously would have led to increased
          complexity while trying to learn a new JavaScript framework on the
          way.<br />
          Going forward, I want to change some of the more complex state
          management of the app (regarding movie favorites) towards a simple API
          fetch in order to minimize the risk of page malfunctioning in certain
          cases (e.g. page reloads, restricted internet connection). In
          addition, I'm planning to include a toggle button to add/remove
          favorites in the movie view, which I learned to implement while
          recreating this project in Angular.
